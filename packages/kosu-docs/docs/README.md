# What is Kosu?

Kosu is a decentralized network and protocol that functions to provide an **aggregated order book** for virtual settlement systems. More specifically, the Kosu network, a bonded proof-of-stake blockchain built on Tendermint Consensus, coacts with the Kosu system contracts, a set of Ethereum-based contracts, to align shareholder incentives and manage the overall network state. The result is a curated, verifiable, public set of order messages.

For market makers, Kosu provides an unrestricted venue for order message broadcast. For traders, Kosu offers a highly accessible liquidity source for a tremendous variety of virtual assets.

## Use cases

Developers, applications, and businesses can leverage Kosu for a variety of use cases, finance-related or otherwise.

-   [Tap into a global liquidity source](./overview/readme.md#protocol-design) from anywhere in the world, without restriction.
-   Complement [0x-mesh](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh) by providing an aggregated view of the p2p mesh network (decentralized relayer) or by providing new peers an additional bootstrapping solution.
-   Build a "matcher" â€“ an exchange system build atop Kosu
-   Trade fully client-side with a Kosu network node, and an Ethereum client
-   Experiment with Kosu event-based API for new types of decentralized applications
-   ...

## Core protocol

The core protocol is implemented as a bonded proof-of-stake aggregation network, supported by a system of Ethereum contracts. The network itself is currently built on [Tendermint Consensus](https://tendermint.com/).

## Developer tools

Paradigm Labs is also leading development of a variety of developer tools to enable rapid development on top of Kosu. A non-exhaustive list is below.

-   [Kosu.js](./kosu.js/) (source code [here](https://github.com/ParadigmFoundation/kosu-monorepo))
    -   Primary library for interacting with the Kosu contract system and network
    -   Includes tools for making, signing, and posting orders
    -   Allows execution/settlement of trades as a taker
    -   Enables "listening" to the Kosu network event API to build order books
